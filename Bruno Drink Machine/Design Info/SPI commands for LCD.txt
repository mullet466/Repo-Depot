SPI commands:

1)	0001scnn:  draw soft button
	--	s = side (1=left, 0=right)
	--	c = clear (1=delete soft button, 0=keep)
	--	nn = position (0,1,2,3)
ex: 00011010 draws a soft button on the left at position #2

2)	0010scnn .. .. ..:  delete/change text for soft button
	--	s = side (1=left, 0=right)
	--	c = delete/!change (1=delete, 0=change)
	--	nn = position (0,1,2,3)
ex: 00100101 clears the text on right-side button #1
ex: 00100001 "Pour It" will set the text on right-side button #1 to be 'Pour
        It', but unlike command 3 which can concatenate, this command can
        only change the button's text, or delete it completely.

3)	0011drrr .. .. ..:  draw/erase text on screen
	--	d = draw/erase (1=draw, 0=erase)
	--	rrr = reserved for future use (formatting?  justification?)
	.. .. .. text in ASCII format
ex: 00111000 "Joe Mama" displays the text 'Joe Mama' on the screen
ex: 00110000 "Joe Mama" clears all the text (except soft button text)
        note:  if there is already text on the screen, setting d=1 will
        append (concatenate) the new text to the end of the existing text.
        clearing d=0 will erase the existing text, and leave the ASCII
        string on the screen instead.

4)	0100xxxx:  clear entire screen
	--	x = don't care
ex: 0100.... clears the display, leaving only the background image

5)	0101pppp:  set backlight max brightness
	--	pppp = power from 0 (off) to 15 (max)
ex: 01010111 sets the backlight brightness to about half-power

6)	0110pppp:  set backlight fade-out timer
	--	pppp = delay time [s] == pppp * 4
ex: 01100110 sets the backlight fade-out timer to 24 seconds
        note:  using this command with pppp=0 will disable the fade-out timer

7)	0111trrr:  set backlight fade-out rate
	--	t = "two-tone" fade-out (1=two-tone, 0=liinear)
	--	rrr = rate rrr*5 == %/s
ex: 01110110 sets the backlight fade-out timer to 30 %/sec
        note:  used in two-tone mode, this command will fade the backlight
        slowly until ~66%, during which time any user interaction will be
        acknowledged and will restore brightness.  When two-tone mode is used,
        rrr*2 is used for the first fade, and rrr*4 for the second, meaning
        01111110 will fade slowly at 12%/s until ~66% brightness is reached,
        and then at 24%/s until 0% (off).
99)	1000nnnn:  something on the USB port...  to be decided at a later date



example program:

// other code
LCD_Start();        // pull chip select low

LCD_Write(0x10);    // draw button in top-right
LCD_Write(0x11);    // draw button in second-from-top-right
LCD_Write(0x13);    // draw button in bottom-right

LCD_Write(0x20);    // text for button in top-right
LCD_Write("Pour It!");
LCD_Write(0x21);    // text for button in second-from-top-right
LCD_Write("Modify");
LCD_Write(0x23);    // text for button in bottom-right
LCD_Write("Cancel");

LCD_Write(0x38);    // draw screen's text
LCD_Write("You've selected cranberry juice and vodka.  Is this correct?");
